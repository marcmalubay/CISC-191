# Activity: Collections

## Objective

Identify palindrome and implement using deque 

## Pre-requisite

Review the "Collections" lecture before attending the lab. 

## Task

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backwards and forwards. Write a code which uses deque and tests whether a line of text is a palindrome. 
The program reads a line, then outputs whether the input is a palindrome or not.

__Expected input__

civic

__Expected output__

Yes, civic is a palindrome.

__Expected input__

rotostor

__Expected output__

No, "rotostor" is not a palindrome.

>**Note:** Ignore punctuation and spacing. Assume all alphabetic characters are lowercase.
>
>Special case: A one-character string is a palindrome.
>
>Hint: The deque must be a Deque of Characters, but ordinary chars will be automatically converted to Characters when added to the deque.

## Challenges
Finding a way to reliably figure out if a word was a palindrome was a difficult problem. The logic behind finding the amount of odd characters in the palindrome
took a bit of thinking, since it is not so obvious when you look at a palindrome that there cannot be more than one odd amount of characters. Writing up the logic
was not too complex after coming to this realization.
